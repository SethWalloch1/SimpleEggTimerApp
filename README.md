# SimpleEggTimerApp
This is a simple app where the user chooses how long they want to boil an egg for. The choices are soft, medium, and hard boiled. When the user selects an option and presses the "GO" button it takes them to another page where it displays how long you should boil the egg for. 

This was created using Android Studio and the language it was coded in was Kotlin.
